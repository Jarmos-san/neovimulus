This repository contains the source code for working on a containerised Neovim
environment. I use this project to experiment with various Neovim configurations
which otherwise would be difficult on my work environment. Containerising a
Neovim environment takes away the pain of backing up older configuration &
replacing them once I'm done experimenting with newer Neovim configurations.

So, if you work with or have a keen interest in using Neovim, this containerised
environment is perfect for experimentation. You simply need to _pull_ the Docker
image from the registry, see how things work out & delete the container (_and
the image_) after you're done!

## ü¶Æ How to Use the Project

Using the project is **VERY** simple & all you'll need is [Docker][5] & a
terminal emulator (I prefer [Kitty][7]). So, if you've Docker installed on your
local machine, you simply need to download the Docker Image & spin it up.

For a detailed instructions on getting started with the project, I suggest
taking a look at the [Usage Instructions & Guidelines][12]. The said section
discusses everything about setting up the configuration files, installing
plugins & much more. So, do give it a thorough read before diving head-first
into the project.

## ü´Ç Contributing & Supporting the Project

This project wouldn't have seen the light of the day without the community
backing. And this is also the primary reason why the project is released &
maintained as a seperate project instead of a "module" of my [dotfiles][3]
repository.

Hence, you're free to support or contribute to this project in any way you
prefer. But before you do so, the following section(s) will help you get
started.

### How to Contribute to the Project

There are numerous ways to contribute to the project & here are a few ways I can
think of on the top of my head.

- Found bugs? Report it by opening an [issue thread][4].
- Have a better plugin or an enhancement suggestions? Let the author know about
  it.
- Are you interested in writing Lua code or perhaps use this project as your
  own? Then feel free to share a PR or two.
- Found the project useful to get started with working on Neovim ASAP? Then
  consider sponsoring the author as it keeps him motivated & pays the bills.

To learn more about contributing to the project, refer to the "[Developer
Guidelines][13]" section of the wiki. Also don't forget to check out the more
detailed instructions as laid down in the "[Contributing Guidelines][14]" for
the project.

That said, if you've any questions related to the development of this project,
please feel to reach out to author & maintainer of the project!

## üìö Informative Resources for Learning About the Tools

Neovim has a significant learning curve but its worthwhile especially for
power-users (_and if you suffer from [Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS)][15]_). So if
you're starting to learn to Vim, I've also compiled a couple of resources on the
same topic. You can find all the list of resources in "[Learning Resources][16]"
section of the wiki.
