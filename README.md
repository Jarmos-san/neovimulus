# üç± A Minimal & Hackable Neovim Configuration Framework!

I have been using Neovim for years now and the custom Neovim environment I use
for software development was developed over all the years I have been using the
tool. Some coworkers/friends noticed my work environment and often asks me to
share my configurations for their usage as well. In that case, I would generally
share my [dotfiles][1] repository but unfortunately sharing my personal dotfiles
is not a stable solution here. Since that repository is ever-changing and is
obviously **VERY** personalised. And suffice to say my personal preferences
might not suit someone else's needs! Hence, I created a Neovim configuration
framework instead.

## Why to Use This Neovim Configuration?

As mentioned earlier, I created this project to share my Neovim configurations
with friends and coworkers. While I could guide them towards using other
existing more popular alternatives like [NvChad][2], [LazyVim][3],
[AstroNvim][4] & more, I felt they beats the purpose of using Neovim in the
first place!

The developers of Neovim created the tool with hackability and customisation in
mind. And the out-of-the-box IDE-like experience the aforementioned alternatives
provides does not serve much justice to the existence of the tool itself. There
is also the [kickstart.nvim][5] which I found a "_bit too minimal_" and not
suitable for full-time software development.

Neovimulus on the other hand, takes a middle ground, its neither "_too minimal_"
nor is it bloated with unnecessary features like the other configuration
frameworks. Like its cousin projects, Neovimulus provides ample ways to automate
the installation process (which in itself can be a never-wrecking process
especially for getting LSP to work). On top of it, the project keeps enough room
for further hacking if the user ever decides to go down that path!

In fact, Neovimulus users are also **STRONGLY** recommended to take a look at
the source code of the project. The source code is heavily documented for this
exact reason. And trust me this practice should make you comfortable to get
started with your journey to customise your own [Personalised Developement
Environment (PDE)][6].

In other words, Neovimulus stays out of your way where it needs to but holds
your hand where it needs to

## ü¶Æ How to Install Neovimulus

Using this project is rather quite straightforward, you only need to invoke
certain scripts and let those scripts do their thing. And for those you who are
absolutely new the world of Neovim, I welcome you wholeheartedly! Refer to the
["resources"](#Resources) section if you need some help to learn the basics of
using Neovim in the first place.

**NOTE**: Its **RECOMMENDED** to take a look at the [scripts][7] and understand
what they do before you invoke them.

### Installing Neovimulus

Before you proceed ahead with the installation procedure, please ensure you have
the following set of prerequisite tools installed and running:

- [Git][8] for downloading/updating Neovim plugins.
- [Neovim][9] for obvious reasons.
- [cURL][10] for downloading various stuff like the LSP server binaries.
- [GCC][11] for compiling the Treesitter parsers which provides better syntax
  highlighting.

With the prerequisite tools installed and verified, run the following command:

```console
curl -fsSL <TODO-URL> | bash -c
```

Once the script completes execution, run Neovim by invoking the `nvim` command
on the interactive shell environment and the plugins should be automatically
installed for you. Take note, the first time you invoke the `nvim` command it
might appear to have hanged, but do not worry about it. Neovim is attempting to
run a `git` command in the background to setup [lazy.nvim][12] (a plugin manager
for Neovim).

Thereafter here are a couple of important commands which you should bear in mind
for keeping the environment up-to date:

- `:Lazy sync` to update the Neovim plugins and generate the `lazy-lock.json`
  file. For more information on the plugin manager, check out the documentations
  at `:h lazy`
- `Mason` and `MasonToolsUpdate` to keep a track of all the LSP servers and
  keeping them up-to date. For more information on the tool, check out the
  documentations at `:h mason` and `:h mason-tool-installer`.
- `TSUpdate` to fetch the latest Treesitter updates and updating the parsers for
  better syntax highlighting & much more. For more documentations about
  Treesitter support, check out the documentations at `:h treesitter`.

### Brief Usage Guidelines

### Uninstalling Neovimulus

Just as how easy it is to install Neovimulus, its equally easier to remove
Neovimulus. There's a automation script which will remove all data related to
Neovimulus from you local system.

That said, run the following command to get rid of Neovimulus:

```console
curl -fsSL <TODO-URL> | bash -c
```

Do note, the script performs certain destructive actions, so verify the contents
of the script before invoking it!

## üìö Resources to Use (Neo)Vim

Neovim (which is a fork of [Vim][16] btw) has a bit of learning curve but it
yields in dividends if you can invest the time and effort to learn to use the
tool! So here is a non-exhaustive list of resources to learn to use, manage
and/or customise your Neovim experience:

1. [Learn Vim the Smart Way][17] to learn to use the very basics of Vim.
2. [Guide to Use Lua in Nvim][18] to learn to code with Lua for customising
   Neovim (or even developing plugins).
3. The inbuilt "Vim Tutor" (see `:h vimtutor` for documentations) or refer to
   this online write-up - [Vimtutor by University College London][19].
4. [Vim Adventures][20] to learn Vim through an interative game on the browser!

Are you aware of more helpful resources and/or feel I missed out on something?
Then please feel free to open a PR.
